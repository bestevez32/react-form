A React/Redux application that

1. Allows a user to enter a first name, last name and a list of hobbies.
2. Has a clear button that resets the data.
3. Has a submit button that submits the data.
4. Has a mock loading state with a timeout that fires on submit button click to simulate an API call.
5. Displays all submitted data on screen.
6. Supports multiple entries.

Developer Notes:

The project is hosted at: https://bestevez32.github.io/react-form/

This was built in order to demonstrate two seperate ways to create forms in a React application. The first was built using a Functional Component form which relied on hooks to manage state. The second used Class Component form which leverages Redux to manage state.

There is code in the index.js file which allows for the use of Redux DevTools in the Chrome Developer Console. This tool allows the user / developer an inspector for Redux state in the application. The extension can be found at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en
